The META folder for the current release and the previous release must be in the releases folder (e.g. releases/2025AA/META). The reports take some time to run. You can monitor their progress in the terminal after running 'npm start'. ",
  "note2": "Below, a line count comparison will display. This shows the number of rows in the previous release and the current release and how much it changed. If there is a report for a particular file, it will be linked here. The notes field will guide on on how to interpret the report results. You can edit the notes field. ",
