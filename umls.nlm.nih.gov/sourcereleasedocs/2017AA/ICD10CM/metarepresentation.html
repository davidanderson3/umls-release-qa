        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        Note:  ICD10CM_2017_2016_10_19 is a minor update to correct an omission in processing ICD10CM_2017. A small number of atoms, relationships and the "NOTE" attribute were missing in 2017AA. The changes listed here are in comparison to ICD10CM_2016.

            submitted in TREF (Terminology Representation and Exchange

            processed for tabular data.</li>
