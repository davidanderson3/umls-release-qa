<h4>MRCXT File Builder</h4>
<p>
MRHIER.RRF has replaced the file MRCXT, which is no longer created by default. You are strongly encouraged to replace uses of MRCXT with MRHIER. MRHIER.RRF provides compete hierarchical information in a computable form which is much more compact and customizable for your purposes. MRCXT information is incomplete yet can be massive, increasing the size of the full Metathesaurus by over 66 percent. 
</p>
<p>
If you decide to use the MRCXT builder, carefully consider your selections — for example, some sources have very large numbers of siblings with little relatedness or many, many children. Creating a MRCXT file with a large number of siblings or children can take over 15 hours. 
</p>
<p>
MRCXT Builder enables you to generate and customize MRCXT.RRF for your subsets from the information found in the MRHIER.RRF and MRCONSO.RRF files.
