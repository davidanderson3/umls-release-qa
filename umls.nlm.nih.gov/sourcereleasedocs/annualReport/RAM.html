<p><b>Authority</b><br />
The Quick Medical Reference (QMR) Clinically Related Terms are
the results of an algorithm developed by Randolf A. Miller at
Vanderbilt University. The algorithm has since been incorporated
by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) into its Metathesaurus
development processes.</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br />
The QMR Clinically Related Terms algorithm is used to discover
synonymy within the Metathesaurus.</p>
<p><b>Description</b><br />
QMR Clinically Related Terms contains "clinically similar"
relationships between the QMR vocabulary and the
Metathesaurus.</p>
<p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br />
The algorithm was developed using a newer version of QMR than
the version in the Metathesaurus. Any terms, contained in the
relationships, that were not found in the Metathesaurus version
of QMR were inserted as QMR Clinically Related Terms source
terms.</p>
<p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br />
QMR Clinically Related Terms was last updated in the
Metathesaurus in 2000.</p>
