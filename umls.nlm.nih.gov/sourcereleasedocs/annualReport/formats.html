<h4>Metathesaurus Data Formats</h4>
<p>
Metathesaurus users may select from two relational formats: the Rich Release Format (RRF), first introduced in 2004, and the Original Release Format (ORF). Both are available as output options of MetamorphoSys, the installation and customization program.
</p>
<p>
Developers are encouraged to use the RRF, which offers significant advantages in source vocabulary transparency (that is, ability to exactly represent the detailed semantics of each source vocabulary); in the ability to generate complete and accurate change sets between versions of the Metathesaurus; and in more convenient representations of concept name, source, and hierarchical context information.
</p>
<p>
Neither Metathesaurus format is fully normalized. By design, there is duplication of data among different files and within certain files. In particular, relationships between different Metathesaurus concepts appear twice (e.g., from entry A to entry B and from entry B to entry A). Developers will need to make their own decisions about the extent to which this redundancy should be retained, reduced, or increased for their specfic applications.
