<h4>PCDS97 - Patient Care Data Set, 1997</h4>
<p><b>Authority</b><br />
The Patient Care Data Set (PCDS) was developed by Judy Ozbolt
at the University of Virginia along with member institutions of
the University HealthSystem Consortium. It is now maintained by
the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br />
PCDS serves as a set of standard terms to represent and
capture clinical data in patient care information systems.</p>
<p><b>Description</b><br />
PCDS is a compilation of terms that represent patient
problems, patient care goals, goal achievement status, and
patient care orders. Terms are organized into 22 components,
which were modified from those identified by Virginia Saba in the
Home Health Care Classification (see the HHC source synopsis).
Each component contains three axes &ndash; Problems, Goals, and
Orders &ndash; each made up of a set of defined atomic-level
elements.</p>
<p><b>Audience</b><br />
PCDS is used by nurses and others to plan patient care and to
document clinical events.</p>
<p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br />
PCDS was last updated in the Metathesaurus in 1999.</p>
