<p><b>Authority</b><br />
The Read Codes were developed by Dr. James Read. The U.K.
National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS
CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes.</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br />
Read Codes are a standard terminology for describing the care
and treatment of patients.</p>
<p><b>Description</b><br />
Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms,
and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including
signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations,
occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances.</p>
<p>Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. Clinical Terms
Version 3 (CTV3) has been merged with the Systematized
Nomenclature of Medicine &ndash; Reference Terminology (SNOMED
RT<sup>&reg;</sup>), resulting in the creation of SNOMED &ndash; Clinical
Terms (SNOMED CT<sup>&reg;</sup>). For more information about SNOMED CT in
the Metathesaurus, see the SNOMED CT source synopsis.</p>
<p><b>Audience</b><br />
Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized
information systems.</p>
<p><b>Update Frequency</b><br />
Read Codes are updated in April and October.</p>
<p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br />
Read Codes were last updated in the Metathesaurus in 2000.</p>
