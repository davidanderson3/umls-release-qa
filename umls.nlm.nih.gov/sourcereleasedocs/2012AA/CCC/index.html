 <p><b>Authority</b><br />
 Virginia Saba and colleagues at the Georgetown University School
 of Nursing developed the Home Health Care Classification (HHCC) System, now known as
 the Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System.</p>
 <p><b>Purpose</b><br />
 CCC provides a standardized framework and a unique coding
 structure for assessing, documenting, and classifying patient
 care by nurses and other clinical practitioners.</p>
 <p><b>Description</b><br />
 HHHC is composed of two sets of interrelated terminologies
 &ndash; Nursing Diagnoses and Nursing Interventions. These
 terminologies are classified using a coded framework consisting
 of 21 Care Components, which are modeled around the six steps of
 the Nursing Process Standards of Care. The six steps are
 Diagnosis, Outcome Identification, Planning, Implementation,
 Evaluation, and Assessment.</p>
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br />
 The Metathesaurus includes CCC Version 2.5.</p>
 <p><b>Audience</b><br />
 Nurses, nurse practitioners, administrators,
 educators, and researchers use CCC.</p>
 <!--<p><b>Update Frequency</b><br />
 Now known as CCC, the classification is updated irregularly;
 it was last updated in 2004.</p> -->
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br />
 CCC is an updated source in the 2012AA Metathesaurus release.</p>
