 <p><b>Authority</b><br/>
 The Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan produces the Minimum Data Set (MDS). The MDS included in the Metathesaurus is extracted from LOINC<sup>&reg;</sup> and may not be a complete representation of the original source.
 </p>
 
 
 <p><b>Purpose</b><br/>
 MDS is a standardized assessment used in the United States to evaluate nursing home residents' functional capability and clinical status with the goal of focusing treatment plans. MDS is required to be completed for residents in certified Medicare and Medicaid facilities.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>Description</b><br/>
 MDS is a standardized, comprehensive instrument that includes an extensive list of assessments such as demographics, fractures, falls, behavior/depression, cognitive status, medications, incontinence, infections, nutrition, dehydration, and activities of nursing home residents.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br/>
 The Metathesaurus representation of MDS is extracted from LOINC and includes terminology representing the 'questions' aspect of the source.</p>
 <p>As of 2010AA, the content of MDS is divided between two   Metathesaurus sources: Minimum Data Set,  2.0 (<a href="../LNC_MDS20/index.html">LNC_MDS20</a>) and Minimum Data Set, 3.0  (LNC_MDS30).&nbsp; The former source LNC_MDS  has been deleted from the Metathesaurus.</p>
 <p>LNC_MDS30 includes content that was previously assigned to LOINC (SAB=&ldquo;LNC  &rdquo; ), as well as new and updated content. <strong></strong></p>
 <p><b>Audience</b><br/>
 MDS is used by health care professionals and clinical managers.
 </p>
 
 
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br/>
   Minimum Data Set, 3.0 (LNC_MDS30) is updated in each Metathesaurus release as  part of <a href="../LNC/index.html">LOINC</a>.</p>
