        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        <p>Two additional files were processed for inclusion in the
          Metathesaurus:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>pub_clinician_descriptor_ids.txt</li>
          <li>pub_consumer_friendly_descriptor_terms.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The CPT documentation for these new descriptors describes
          them as follows:<br/>
          <br/>
          <b> Clinician Descriptors:</b>
         
     <br />The purpose of
          the Clinician Descriptors (CD’s) is to clearly and
          specifically describe precisely the procedure or service
          performed by a physician or qualified healthcare professional
          at the point of care. CPT Clinician Descriptors will also
          reflect the granularity necessary to accurately describe
          clinically relevant information not included in the core CPT
          codeset. As a result, many existing CPT codes will be mapped
          to more than one CD. These CD’s will be easily understandable
          to the physicians or other qualified healthcare professionals
          who have little or no knowledge of coding and are primarily
          concerned with the clinical representation of the data rather
          than the administrative or reimbursement component of the
          data. The CPT category II and Category III codes are
          considered to be out of scope for this release.<br/>
          <br/>
          These descriptors will be valuable to support the
                federal regulation for EHR’s Meaningful Use Stage 2
                objectives:</p>
                <blockquote> <p>
       The Eligible
              Professionals (EP), Eligible Hospitals (EH), or Critical
              Access Hospitals (CAH) who transitions their patient to
              another setting of care or provider of care or refers
              their patient to another provider of care should provide
              summary care record for&nbsp;each transition of care or
              referral. 2014 Edition EHR Certification
              Criteria;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> 170.314(b)(1)

        (Incorporate summary care record)<br /> <br />
       170.314(b)(2)

              (Create and transmit summary care record) </p></blockquote>
            <p>  Other
            intended uses of CPT Clinician Descriptors include defining
            a subset of medical procedures and services within an
            electronic health record, patient summary for transition and
            transfer of care, documentation of medical procedures and
            services, research, clinical and statistical reporting etc </p>
        
       <p>
         <b>Consumer Friendly Descriptors:</b><br/>
        
          The consumer friendly descriptors will translate each code
            descriptor from the official CPT code set into language that
            is easily understood by the average patient and/or his or
            her caregiver. The objective is to simplify the highly
            technical CPT code descriptors into something more patient
            focused and patient friendly. CPT Consumer Friendly
            Descriptors may prove useful in any situation where clear
        communication in nontechnical language is important.</p>
          <p> Consumer friendly descriptors also support the following
            two key objectives of the Meaningful Use Stage 2 proposed
            rule:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide patients clinical summaries for each office
              visit</li>
            <li>To provide patients the ability to view, download, and
              transmit their health information to a third party, such
              as eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, or critical
              access hospitals.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Consumer friendly descriptors have the potential to be used
            within electronic health record patient portals, discharge
            summaries, and explanation of benefits forms.
