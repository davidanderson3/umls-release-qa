<h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
<p>No changes have been made to the format of original data files.
During UMLS source processing, certain relationships are generated
between CPT concepts based on string parsing.
For example, "Anesthesia for closed chest procedures; needle biopsy of
pleura" (code 00522) is given an RO relationships to "Anesthesia for
closed chest procedures;
pneumocentesis"(code 00524). The algorithm to create these
relationships has been changed slightly, resulting in a greater number
of relationships being generated.
These relationships are not submitted or reviewed by the American
Medical Association (AMA), and are attributed to SAB="MTHCH".</p>
</div>
<div id="rep_change_summary" class="rep_block_level_one">
<h3>Original Files:</h3>
<br>
The UMLS uses tab-delimited CPT files submitted by the AMA. The files
used for 2010 are:
<ul>
  <li>LONGULT.txt</li>
  <li>MEDU.txt</li>
  <li>MODUL.txt</li>
  <li>SHORTU.txt</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, updates were extracted from "CPT 2010 Adjunct
File.xls," and "PQRI 2010 Adjunct File.xls."</p>
</div>
<div id="rep_identifers" class="rep_block_level_one">
<h3>Identifiers</h3>
<br>
Identifiers are assigned as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>CODE: For CPT atoms: The CPT Code in the appropriate file (e.g.
in LONGULT.txt for a PT).<br>
For MTHCH atoms: An MTHU# is generated during Metathesaurus source
processing
  </li>
  <li>SAUI: Not Applicable</li>
  <li>SCUI: Same as CODE</li>
  <li>SDUI: Not Applicable</li>
</ul>
