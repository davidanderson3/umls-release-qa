        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
		<p>New ATN: SPECIALTY</p>
        Represents the value of the "Specialty" relationship.  These relationships are to NUCC codes or to
        AMA-created provider codes.  For readability, the ATV for these attributes is created by
        concatenating the "Provider code," "Provdider label," and the "percent utilization of the source code
        by the target specialty," as found in the "utilization qualifier"  of RelationshipGroups_DTK_Pipe.txt.
        For example, CPT CODE "00100" has two SPECIALTY attributes:
        <ul>
        <li>207L00000X/Anesthesiology/59%</li>
		<li>367500000X/Nurse Anesthetist, Certified Registered/39%</li>
		</ul>
