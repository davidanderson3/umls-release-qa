<p><b>Authority</b><br />
The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED<sup>&reg;</sup>),
Second Edition was developed by the College of American
Pathologists. SNOMED intellectual property rights were
transferred to the SNOMED Standards Development Organisation
(SDO) in the formal creation of the IHTSDO (International Health
Terminology SDO).</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br />
SNOMED is a comprehensive nomenclature used to capture patient
encounters in electronic health systems.</p>
<p><b>Description</b><br />
SNOMED concepts are organized into seven axes. The seven axes
are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Topography</li>
<li>Morphology</li>
<li>Etiology</li>
<li>Function</li>
<li>Disease</li>
<li>Procedure</li>
<li>Occupation</li>
</ol>
<p>SNOMED has been superseded by the Systemized Nomenclature of
Human and Veterinary Medicine: SNOMED International, and then by
the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine &ndash; Reference
Terminology (SNOMED RT<sup>&reg;</sup>). SNOMED RT has been merged with Clinical
Terms Version 3 (CTV3), also known as Read Codes, resulting in
the creation of SNOMED &ndash;Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT<sup>&reg;</sup>). For
more information about SNOMED CT in the Metathesaurus, see the
SNOMED CT source synopsis.</p>
<p><b>Audience</b><br />
SNOMED is used by clinicians, nurses, researchers, and other
health professionals.</p>
<p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br />
SNOMED was last updated in the Metathesaurus in 1991.</p>
