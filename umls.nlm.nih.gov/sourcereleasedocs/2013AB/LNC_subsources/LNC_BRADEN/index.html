 <p><b>Authority</b><br/>
 The Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk<sup>&reg;</sup> was developed by Barbara Braden and Nancy Bergstrom. The Braden Scale included in the Metathesaurus is extracted from LOINC<sup>&reg;</sup> and may not be a complete representation of the original source.
 </p>
 
 
 <p><b>Purpose</b><br/>
 The Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk is a clinically validated tool that allows nurses and other health care providers to reliably score a patient/client's level of risk for developing pressure ulcers.  It measures functional capabilities of the patient that contribute to either higher intensity and duration of pressure or lower tissue tolerance for pressure.  Lower levels of functioning indicate higher levels of risk for pressure ulcer development.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>Description</b><br/>
 The Braden Scale is a summated rating scale made up of six subscales scored from 1-4 (1 for low level of functioning and 4 for the highest level or no impairment). Total scores range from 6-23 (one subscale is scored with values of 1-3, only). The subscales measure functional capabilities of the patient that contribute to either higher intensity and duration of pressure, or lower tissue tolerance for pressure. A lower Braden Scale Score indicates lower levels of functioning and, therefore, higher levels of risk for pressure ulcer development.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br/>
 The Metathesaurus representation of the Braden Scale is extracted from the LOINC release files and includes the six subscales as well as observations for total score and the skin assessment panel.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>Audience</b><br/>
 The Braden Scale is used by nurses and other health care providers.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br/>
 The Braden Scale is updated with each Metathesaurus release as part of <a href="../LNC/index.html">LOINC</a>.
