<p><b>Authority</b><br/>
  The U.S. National Library of  Medicine (NLM) produces the US Edition SNOMED CT.</p>
<p>  The Systematized Nomenclature of  Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®) was originally created by the  College of American Pathologists by combining SNOMED RT and Clinical Terms  Version 3. SNOMED CT intellectual property rights were transferred to the  SNOMED Standards Development Organisation (SDO) in the formal creation of the  IHTSDO (International Health Terminology SDO). </p>
<p><b>Purpose</b><br/>
  SNOMED CT aims to improve patient  care through the development of systems to record health care encounters  accurately. </p>
<p>  The US Edition of SNOMED CT facilitates  the use of SNOMED CT as a primary coding terminology for clinical information  in electronic health records, research and clinical trials. It is used with <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/RXNORM/index.html">RxNorm</a> and <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/LNC/index.html">LOINC</a> to cover medications and laboratory tests needs in the US. </p>
<p><b>Description</b><br/>
  The US Edition of SNOMED CT combines  the International Release of SNOMED CT and the US Extension of SNOMED CT</p>
<p>  SNOMED CT provides the core general  terminology for the electronic health record (EHR). The concepts have unique  meanings and formal logic-based definitions organized into hierarchies. Each  International Release includes the core of the terminology (concepts,  descriptions, and relationships), together with works to support the  implementation and use of SNOMED CT, including subsets, cross maps to existing  classifications and coding schemes, and an extensive set of guidelines. <br />
  <br />
  The US Extension to SNOMED CT included the concepts, descriptions, and  relationships accepted by NLM as a formal extension to the SNOMED CT  International Release. NLM  no longer  releases the standalone US Extension.<br />
  The US Edition of SNOMED CT includes  more than 300,000  unique concepts. There  are over 1,000,000 descriptions in SNOMED CT, including synonyms that can be  used to refer to a concept. In addition, there are approximately 903,000  links  or semantic relationships between  the SNOMED CT concepts.<br />
  <br />
  UMLS licensees may <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/downloads.html">download</a> the US Edition  release and International Release files. <br />
  As of 2013AB, the Metathesaurus includes the US Edition and  no longer includes the separate International Release and US Extension.  </p>
<p><b>Audience</b><br/>
SNOMED CT is used by standards setting organizations and in a variety of health care applications.  It is also utilized by developers of electronic health data exchange applications.</p>


<p><b>Update Frequency</b><br/>
  The  US Edition is updated in March and September, approximately one month after  each new International Release. </p>

<p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br/>
The US Edition is an updated source in each Metathesaurus release.
