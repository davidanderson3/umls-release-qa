  <p><b>Authority</b><br>
  The Quick Medical Reference (QMR) Clinically Related Terms are the results of an algorithm developed by Randolf A. Miller at Vanderbilt University. The algorithm has since been incorporated by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) into its Metathesaurus development processes.</p>

  <p><b>Purpose</b><br>
  The QMR Clinically Related Terms algorithm is used to discover synonymy within the Metathesaurus.</p>

  <p><b>Description</b><br>
  QMR Clinically Related Terms contains "clinically similar" relationships between the QMR vocabulary and the Metathesaurus.</p>

  <p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br>
  The algorithm was developed using a newer version of QMR than the version in the Metathesaurus. Any terms, contained in the relationships, that were not found in the Metathesaurus version of QMR were inserted as QMR Clinically Related Terms source terms.</p>

  <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br>
  QMR Clinically Related Terms was last updated in the Metathesaurus in 2000.</p>
