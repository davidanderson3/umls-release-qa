<p><strong>Authority</strong><br />The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP<sup>&reg;</sup>) is produced and owned by the International Council of Nurses (ICN).</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />ICNP is a unified nursing language system for describing nursing practice. The ICNP terminology was developed to establish an international standard for the description and comparison of nursing practice, and to facilitate the development of cross-mapping between local terms and other terminologies.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br />ICNP elements are used to represent nursing diagnoses, nursing actions, and nursing outcomes. It is based on a seven-axis model. The axes are focus, judgement, time, location, means, action, and client.</p>
<p>ICNP can be used along with existing terminologies through cross-mapping, to develop new vocabularies, and to identify relationships between concepts and vocabularies.</p>
<p>ICNP translations in several languages are produced with the cooperation of the National Nursing Association. For more information about ICNP translations, see the <a href="http://www.icn.ch/what-we-do/icnpr-translations/icnpr-translations-874.html">ICNP Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong><br />ICNP is used by nurses, healthcare organizations, and other healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Update Frequency</strong><br />ICNP is updated every two years.</p>
<p><strong>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</strong><br />ICNP is updated in the Metathesaurus as resources permit.</p>
