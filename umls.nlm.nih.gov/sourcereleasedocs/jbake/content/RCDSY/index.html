  <p><b>Description</b><br>
  This is the Synthesized Terms of Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3).</p>

  <p>Some CTV3 terms contain letters in square brackets ([]), which signify a link between the term and either the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) or the U.K. Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures, Fourth Revision (OPCS-4). The letters and brackets were removed on the Synthesized Terms.</p>

  <p>The Read Codes, now known as Clinical Terms, are included in the Metathesaurus. For more information about Read Codes in the Metathesaurus, see the <a href="../RCD/index.html">CTV3 source synopsis</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br>
  The Synthesized Terms of CTV3 were last updated in the Metathesaurus in 2000.</p>
