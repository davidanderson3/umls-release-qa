      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>Four SABs are assigned to HCPCS data, based on the code value.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Level I codes are copyrighted by the American Medical
          Association (AMA) and are assigned RSAB = "HCPT".</li>
        <li>Level II codes include data copyrighted by the American
          Dental Association&#8217;s Current Dental Terminology (CDT).
          5-character alpha-numeric codes beginning with the letter "D,"
          and are assigned RSAB = "HCDT". All other Level II codes are
          assigned RSAB = "HCPCS."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The standard HCPCS data files do not include a hierarchy. The
        NLM uses the printed book and other resources to generate a
        hierarchy during Metathesaurus source processing. This hierarchy
        has not been reviewed by CMS and is attributed to SAB = "MTHHH."</p>
      <p> HCPCS includes many attributes. When possible, NLM source
        processing has attempted to include an expanded value in the ATV
        field of MRSAT to enable the data to be self-documenting.<br/>
        The expanded values have been extracted from
        HCPCS2012_recordlayout.txt and proc_notes2012.txt as
        appropriate.<br/>
        For example, for the HCPCS Multiple Pricing Indicator Code is
        assigned an ATN of "HMP" in MRSAT.RRF.<br/>
        A value that appears as "A"in the data file is given an expanded
        ATV of "A = Not applicable as HCPCS priced under one
        methodology" in MRSAT.RRF. </p>
