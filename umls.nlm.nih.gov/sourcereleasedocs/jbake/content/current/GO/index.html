<p><b>Authority</b><br/>
The Gene Ontology (GO) project is produced by the GO Consortium.
</p>


<p><b>Purpose</b><br/>
GO is a collaborative effort to address the need for consistent descriptions of gene products in different databases.  The current ontologies of the GO project are molecular function, biological process, and cellular component.
</p>

<p><b>Description</b><br/>
GO collaborators are developing three structured, controlled vocabularies (ontologies) that describe gene products in terms of their associated biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions in a species-independent manner.  GO includes cross-links between the ontologies and the genes and gene products in the collaborating databases, and tools that facilitate the creation, maintainence and use of ontologies.
<br /><br />
GO neither names genes or gene products, nor attempts to provide structured vocabularies beyond its three domains: molecular function, biological process and cellular component.
<br /><br />
The Gene Ontology vocabularies and gene product annotations are available to all public and private sector users, with no licensing requirements.
</p>

<p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br/>
The Metathesaurus representation of GO includes only the three ontologies: molecular function, biological process and cellular component.
</p>

<p><b>Audience</b><br/>
GO is intended for use by system developers who are addressing the need for consistent descriptions of gene products in different databases.
</p>


<p><b>Update Frequency</b><br/>
GO is updated regularly throughout the year.
</p>

<p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br/>
GO is updated annually in the Metathesaurus, as resources permit.
