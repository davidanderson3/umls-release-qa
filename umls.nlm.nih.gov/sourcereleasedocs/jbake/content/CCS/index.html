  <p><b>Authority</b><br>
  The Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for ICD-9-CM was developed and is maintained by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), which is sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).</p>

  <p><b>Purpose</b><br>
  CCS is used to analyze costs, usage, and outcomes associated with patient diagnoses and procedures.</p>

  <p><b>Description</b><br>
  CCS is composed of diagnoses and procedures categories, which are organized in two related classification systems. The single-level system consists of 285 mutually-exclusive diagnosis categories, 231 mutually-exclusive procedure categories, and no hierarchical structure. The multi-level system uses the single-level categories and <i>International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification</i> (ICD-9-CM) codes in a hierarchical system consisting of four levels for diagnoses and three levels for procedures.</p>

  <p>CCS was formerly the Clinical Classifications for Health Policy Research (CCHPR).</p>

  <p><b>Audience</b><br>
  CCS is used by health plans, policymakers, and researchers.</p>

  <p><b>Update Frequency</b><br>
  CCS is updated annually.</p>

  <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br>
  CCS was last updated in the Metathesaurus in 2005.</p>
