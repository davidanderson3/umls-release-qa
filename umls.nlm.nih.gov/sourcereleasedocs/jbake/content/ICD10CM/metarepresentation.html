        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
		<p>There have been no changes to the source format, however Metathesaurus source processing has been updated. 
		TTY = AB atoms are now being created for hierarchical terms (HT); previously they were only created for preferred terms (PT)
		Multiple values of attributes are now concatenated rather than being represented as separate rows in MRSAT.RRF, e.g.:</p>

		<ul style="list-style: none;">

			<li>C41.0|EXCLUDES2|maxillary sinus (C31.0)</li>
			<li>C41.0|EXCLUDES2|upper jaw (C03.0)</li>
			<li>C41.0|EXCLUDES2|malignant neoplasm of jaw bone (lower) (C41.1)</li>
