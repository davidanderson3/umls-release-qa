  <p><b>Authority</b><br>
  The Patient Care Data Set (PCDS) was developed by Judy Ozbolt at the University of Virginia along with member institutions of the University HealthSystem Consortium. It is now maintained by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p>

  <p><b>Purpose</b><br>
  PCDS serves as a set of standard terms to represent and capture clinical data in patient care information systems.</p>

  <p><b>Description</b><br>
  PCDS is a compilation of terms that represent patient problems, patient care goals, goal achievement status, and patient care orders. Terms are organized into 22 components, which were modified from those identified by Virginia Saba in the Home Health Care Classification (see the HHC source synopsis). Each component contains three axes &ndash; Problems, Goals, and Orders &ndash; each made up of a set of defined atomic-level elements.</p>

  <p><b>Audience</b><br>
  PCDS is used by nurses and others to plan patient care and to document clinical events.</p>

  <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br>
  PCDS was last updated in the Metathesaurus in 1999.</p>
