<p><b>Authority</b><br/>
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was developed by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and is owned by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) acting as trustee for the ICH steering committee. The Maintenance and Support Services Organization (MSSO) serves as the repository, maintainer, and distributor of MedDRA as well as the source for the most up-to-date information regarding MedDRA and its application within the biopharmaceutical industry and regulators.
</p>


<p><b>Purpose</b><br/>
MedDRA was designed for the specific use of sharing regulatory information and clinical safety data for human medical products worldwide. 
</p>

<p><b>Description</b><br/>
MedDRA is an international medical terminology with an emphasis on use for data entry, retrieval, analysis, and display. It applies to all phases of drug development, excluding animal toxicology, and to the health effects and malfunction of devices. An appendix includes concept descriptions which describe how a medical concept is interpreted, used, and classified within the MedDRA terminology.  It is not intended as a medical definition. The concept descriptions are intended to aid the consistent and accurate use of MedDRA in coding, retrieval, and analysis. 
</p>

<p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br/>
The Metathesaurus representation of MedDRA includes all data from the .asc files in the MedAscii directory of the MedDRA release. The Metathesaurus also includes certain expansions of abbreviations in terms as well as Americanizations for British spellings.
