  <h3>Notes</h3>

  <p>Four SABs are assigned to HCPCS data, based on the code value.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Level I codes are copyrighted by the American Medical Association (AMA) and are assigned RSAB = "HCPT".</li>

    <li>Level II codes include data copyrighted by the American Dental Association&rsquo;s Current Dental Terminology (CDT). 5-character alpha-numeric codes beginning with the letter "D," and are assigned RSAB = "HCDT". All other Level II codes are assigned RSAB = "HCPCS."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The standard HCPCS data files do not include a hierarchy. The NLM uses the printed book and other resources to generate a hierarchy during Metathesaurus source processing. This hierarchy has not been reviewed by CMS and is attributed to SAB = "MTHHH."</p>

  <p>HCPCS includes many attributes. When possible, NLM source processing has attempted to include an expanded value in the ATV field of MRSAT to enable the data to be self-documenting.<br>
  The expanded values have been extracted from HCPCS2012_recordlayout.txt and proc_notes2012.txt as appropriate.<br>
  For example, for the HCPCS Multiple Pricing Indicator Code is assigned an ATN of "HMP" in MRSAT.RRF.<br>
  A value that appears as "A"in the data file is given an expanded ATV of "A = Not applicable as HCPCS priced under one methodology" in MRSAT.RRF.</p>
