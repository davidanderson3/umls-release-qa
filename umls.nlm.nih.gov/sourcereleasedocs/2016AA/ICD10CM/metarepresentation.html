        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        <p>There have been no changes to the data format. There were no
          updates to the atoms (order) file. The mapping data was
          updated.
        </p>
        Changes for this version are:
        <ul>
          <li> Change totype from SDUI to BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION_SDUI when
            there is an AND </li>
          <li> Fixed bug, changed XRTARGETID from NODX to NOI9 </li>
          <li> Fixed bug in placement of decimal for ICD9CM "E"
            codes. </li>

          addition, the Metathesaurus uses files submitted in TREF
          (Terminology Representation and Exchange Format). These files
          are produced by the National Center for Health Statistics
          (NCHS) for Metathesaurus processing, and are not currently
          available publicly. TREF was developed by the NLM and is a
          subset of the Rich Release Format (RRF) - the format in which
          the UMLS Metathesaurus is released. The following files are
          submitted for ICD10CM:<br/>

          MRCONSO.TREF<br/>
          MRDOC.TREF<br/>

          MRSAB.TREF<br/>
          MRSAT.TREF<br/>
          <br/>
          The TREF files align with the publically-available .pdf
          release of ICD10CM. When relevant, the origin of data from the
          NCHS .pdf file is noted in the tables below.<br/>
