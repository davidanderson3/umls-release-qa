  <p><b>Authority</b><br/>
  Metathesaurus CPT<sup>&reg;</sup> Hierarchical Terms (MTHCH) is produced by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM).  
  </p>
 
  
  <p><b>Description</b><br/>
  MTHCH is based on information found in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codebook published by the American Medical Association (AMA), as well as on data algorithmically extracted from the CPT files.
  <br /><br />
  MTHCH was created to establish a hierarchy for CPT codes, as well as to represent additional relationships between CPT codes.  
  <br /><br />
  For more information about CPT, see the <a href="../CPT/index.html">CPT source synopsis</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br/>
 
  MTHCH terms provide a hierarchy for CPT codes based on the hierarchy found in the CPT codebook published by the AMA.  MTHCH also contributes lexically-derived relationships (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/release/abbreviations.html#mrdoc_REL">RO/RN/RB</a>) between CPT codes.  MTHCH does not necessarily include hierarchical terms and relationships represented in the AMA's &quot;CPT Developer's Toolkit&quot;.  
  </p>
  
  
  <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br/>
  MTHCH is updated annually, in conjunction with CPT.
