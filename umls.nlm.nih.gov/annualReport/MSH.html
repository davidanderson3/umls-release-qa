<p><b>Authority</b><br/>
 The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH<sup>&reg;</sup>) are developed and maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM).
 </p>
 <p><b>Purpose</b><br/>
 The MeSH thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary used for indexing, cataloging, and searching for biomedical and health-related information and documents. It enables retrieval systems, such as PubMed, to provide subject searching of data.
 </p>
 <p><b>Description</b><br/>
 MeSH consists of sets of terms naming descriptors in a hierarchical structure that permits searching at various levels of specificity.
 <br /><br />
 The three basic types of MeSH records are Descriptors, Qualifiers (subheadings), and Supplementary Concept Records.
 <br /><br />
 MeSH has over 25,000 Descriptors; 83 topical Qualifiers; 190,000 Supplementary Concept Records; and 172,000 entry terms.
 <br /><br />
 MeSH is continually updated by NLM health science subject specialists. New terms from scientific literature and research can be recommended for addition to MeSH.
 <br /><br />
 MeSH is also included in RxNorm.
 </p>
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Scope</b><br/>
 The Metathesaurus also includes the following MeSH translations:

 <p><b>Audience</b><br/>
 The MeSH vocabulary is designed for use by NLM for indexing and searching the MEDLINE database of journal citations and cataloging the NLM collection. 
 <br /><br />
 MeSH is used by indexers, subject catalogers, online searchers, and in retrieval systems.
 </p>
 <p><b>Update Frequency</b><br/>
 A revised MeSH vocabulary is released annually; Descriptors and Qualifiers are updated annually while Supplementary Concept Records are updated continuously.
 </p>
 <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br/>
