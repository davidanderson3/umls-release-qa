<p>Convergent Medical Terminology (CMT) is a set of clinician- and patient friendly terminology, linked to US and international interoperability standards, and related vocabulary development tools and utilities. Developed by Kaiser Permanente over many years for use within its health-IT systems, CMT now includes more than 75,000 concepts.</p>

<p>In September 2010 Kaiser Permanente, the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO) and the US Department of Health and Human Services jointly announced Kaiser Permanente's donation of their CMT content and related tooling to the IHTSDO. The donation consists of terminology content already developed, a set of tools to help create and manage terminology and processes to control the quality of terminology that is developed. CMT also includes mappings to classifications and standard vocabularies including SNOMED CT.</p>

<p>The files include:</p>
<ul>
<li>descriptions that are used as display names for Clinicians in Kaiser Permanente's electronic medical record,</li>
<li>corresponding patient display names that the members see in their PHR portal, and</li>
<li>mappings to other terminologies.</li>
</ul>
