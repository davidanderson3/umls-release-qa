<p>RxNav is a browser for several drug information sources, including RxNorm, RxTerms and NDF-RT. RxNav finds drugs in RxNorm from the names and codes in its constituent vocabularies. RxNav displays links from clinical drugs, both branded and generic, to their active ingredients, drug components and related brand names. RxNav also provides lists of NDC codes and links to package inserts in DailyMed. The RxTerms record for a given drug can be accessed through RxNav, as well as clinical information from NDF-RT, including pharmacologic classes, mechanisms of action and physiologic effects.</p>
