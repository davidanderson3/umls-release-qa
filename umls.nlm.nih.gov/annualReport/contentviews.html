<td>This Content View contains the subset of SNOMED CT concepts that are most frequently used in problem lists. The subset is derived from datasets from large health care institutions. The most commonly used problem list terms are mapped to SNOMED CT and other UMLS sources. The use of SNOMED CT contents in this subset is subject to the SNOMED CT license requirements. The use of SNOMED CT is free in IHTSDO member countries (including the U.S.) and low income countries.
