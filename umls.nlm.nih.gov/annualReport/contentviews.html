<h4>Content Views</h4>
<p>
A Content View (CV) is any definable subset of the Metathesaurus that is useful for some specific purpose. Content Views are either created by NLM or submitted to the Metathesaurus by external authorities. Membership may be defined in a variety of ways, including:
<ul>
<li>A list of Metathesaurus UIs (CUIs, SUIs, AUIs, etc.), maintained over time.</li>
<li>A list of sources that participate in the view.</li>
<li>A complex query or algorithm that computes sets of atoms, source concepts, or relationships based on well-defined criteria and may also be configured to include other connected information, such as attributes or relationships. </li>
</ul>
