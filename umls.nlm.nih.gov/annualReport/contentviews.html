<td>This Content View provides a UMLS-enhanced view of the Veterans Health Administration and Kaiser Permanente (VA/KP) Problem List Subset of SNOMED, which is one of the controlled terminologies used for Structured Product Labeling (SPL). SPL is a document markup standard approved by Health Level Seven (HL7) and adopted by FDA as a mechanism for exchanging medication information. This set of SNOMED terms and codes is freely reusable worldwide without licensing or intellectual property restrictions. This Content View consists of all UMLS concepts containing the active SNOMED concepts in the Problem List Subset. It includes contents from SNOMED and other source vocabularies with no additional licensing restrictions. All non-English, obsolete and suppressible contents are excluded.

The most commonly used problem list terms are mapped to SNOMED CT and other UMLS sources. The use of SNOMED CT contents in this subset is subject to the SNOMED CT license requirements. The use of SNOMED CT is free in IHTSDO member countries (including the U.S.) and low income countries.

*Note that the "UMLS enhanced VA/KP Problem List Subset of SNOMED (Level 0+SNOMED+MDR)" Content View is a superset of the "UMLS enhanced VA/KP Problem List Subset of SNOMED (Level 0+SNOMED)" Content View, and it is unnecessary to create a subset containing both views.
