<p>The VSAC is a repository and authoring tool for public value sets created by external programs. Value sets are lists of codes and corresponding terms, from NLM-hosted standard clinical vocabularies (such as SNOMED CT®, RxNorm, LOINC® and others), that define clinical concepts to support effective and interoperable health information exchange. The VSAC does not create value set content. The VSAC also provides downloadable access to all official versions of value sets specified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs). For information on CMS eCQMs, visit the eCQI Resource Center.</p>


<p>The VSAC is provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and CMS.</p>
