<p>The purpose of the Nursing Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT is to facilitate the use of SNOMED CT as the primary coding terminology for problem lists or other summary level clinical documentation.</p>

<p>The use of a common list of SNOMED CT concepts will maximize data interoperability among institutions. However, local problem list vocabularies often need to be expanded to satisfy specific user needs. Users should check to see if SNOMED CT contains terminology for concepts they need to fulfill their local requirements and use case. The UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) includes a SNOMED CT browser that may be used for this purpose. The SNOMED CT Browser is available through the SNOMED CT menu of the UTS.</p>

<p>If needed concepts are not found in the terminology, users are encouraged to submit them for inclusion in the US Extension of SNOMED CT. To submit a new nursing problem concept, go to U.S. SNOMED CT Content Request System (USCRS). Additional assistance on submitting requests can be found on the UMLS Video Learning Resources page. In this way, the link to the Nursing Problem List concepts is maintained and divergence of problem list vocabularies can be minimized. Institutions that use their own problem list vocabularies are encouraged to map them to SNOMED CT with a focus on the Nursing Problem List concepts to facilitate data interoperability.</p>
