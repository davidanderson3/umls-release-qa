<p>Expressions that contain two or more concept identifiers are referred to as postcoordinated expressions. Postcoordination combines concepts and allows more detail to be added to the meaning represented by a single concept. A postcoordinated expression is not just a list of concept identifiers, it follows a set of rules that mimic the way attributes and values are used to define SNOMED CT concepts.</p>

<pre>Example:  Postcoordinated representation of "Laparoscopic emergency appendectomy"
Although SNOMED CT contains the concept |laparoscopic emergency appendectomy|, it is also possible to represent this clinical phrase using the following postcoordinated expression.<br />

80146002|appendectomy|:260870009|priority|=25876001|emergency|, 425391005|using access device|=86174004|laparoscope|<br />

This postcoordinated expression has exactly the same meaning as the precoordinated expression
174041007|laparoscopic emergency appendectomy|<br />

The fact that the two expressions have the same meaning can be computed because
174041007|laparoscopic emergency appendectomy| is a fully-defined subtype descendant of 80146002|appendectomy| ; and
the only differences between the defining attributes of these concepts are the addition of 
260870009|priority|=25876001|emergency|
425391005|using access device| = 86174004|laparoscope|</pre>

<p>The example above shows that postcoordination can be applied even when a single concept is available to represent the required means. However, the real strength of postcoordination is that it allows a clinical phrase to be represented even when the precise concept is not present in SNOMED CT. In these cases, postcoordinated refinements can be applied to an existing concept to more precisely capture the required meaning.</p>

<pre>Example:  Postcoordinated representation of "Laparoscopic removal of device from abdomen"
SNOMED CT does not contain a concept that represents this clinical idea. However, it is possible to represent it using the following postcoordinated expression. 
68526006|removal of device from abdomen|:425391005|using access device|= 6174004|laparoscope|</pre>

<p>Postcoordinated expressions may be created at run-time by selection of individual facets of a concept. For example, to indicate the nature and location of a fracture for a particular bone and, where relevant, whether the bone affected is on the right or left. Some applications allow generation of postcoordinated expression using natural language processing. Alternatively, postcoordinated expression can be selected during user interface design and bound to simple data entry options. In these cases, the user may not be aware that the information is being captured in a postcoordinated form.</p>
