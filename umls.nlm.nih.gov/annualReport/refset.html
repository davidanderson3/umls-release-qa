<p>A reference set (or refset) is a standard format for maintaining and distributing a set of references to SNOMED CT components and optionally associating referenced components with additional information.</p>

<p>A reference set can be used to represent a subset of components (concepts, descriptions or relationships).</p>

<p>A reference set that associates additional information with referenced components can be used to support various different purposes, such as representing:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>An ordered lists of components;</li>
               <li>Sets of associations between components;</li>
               <li>Maps between SNOMED CT concepts and codes in other code systems, classifications or
                  knowledge resources.
               </li>
            </ul>
