<p>A program release is a group of value set expansions (code lists) that you publish under one program release label. The benefit of publishing your group of value sets as a program release is your end users can search for and obtain the entire set of value sets that belong to your program. A program release can be a new release or it can be an update to a previous program release in VSAC. You can update your program release on a regular or ad hoc basis.</p>

<p>Examples of program releases in VSAC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Centers of Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQM) value sets
<li>CMS Hybrid Measures value sets
<li>Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) value sets
</ul>

<p>VSAC creates a program release in partnership with a value set author or steward, who then assumes the role of the program release manager. A program release may consist of one or more release items with which value sets are associated. For example, a program release may contain value sets specified by one or more quality measures. These quality measures are release items for a program release in VSAC. Each release item has a group of value sets associated with it. For a new program release that is not an update to a previous release, the program release manager can inform VSAC of value sets association to release items by submitting one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spreadsheet of value sets for a release, grouped by release item associations to value sets
<li>HQMF files for each measure, if applicable, produced by a measure authoring tool
</ul>

<p>If your value sets were published previously in VSAC, you may need to make changes to the value sets to reflect current changes in code systems. For example, the CMS eCQM value sets that were released in May 2017 were later updated by CMS to reflect code system updates, and were published with these changes in a subsequent program release.</p>
