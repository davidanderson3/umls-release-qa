<h3>MetaMap</h3>
<p>MetaMap is a highly configurable program developed by Dr. Alan (Lan) Aronson at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to map biomedical text to the UMLS Metathesaurus or, equivalently, to discover Metathesaurus concepts referred to in text. MetaMap uses a knowledge-intensive approach based on symbolic, natural-language processing (NLP) and computational-linguistic techniques. Besides being applied for both IR and data-mining applications, MetaMap is one of the foundations of NLM's Medical Text Indexer (MTI) which is being used for both semiautomatic and fully automatic indexing of biomedical literature at NLM.</p>

<h3>MetaMapLite</h3>
<p>The primary goal of MetaMapLite to provide a near real-time named-entity recognizer which is not a rigorous as MetaMap but is much faster while allowing users to customize and augment its behavior for specific purposes.
It uses some of the tables used by MetaMap but all lexical variants used in the table are pre-processed. Named Entities are found using longest match. Restriction by UMLS source and Semantic type is optional. Part-of-speech tagging which improves precision by a small amount (at the cost of speed) is also optional. Negation detection is available using either Wendy Chapman's context or a native negation detection algorithm based on Wendy Chapman's NegEx which is somewhat less effective, but faster.</p>
