 <p><b>Authority</b><br/>
 The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT<sup>&reg;</sup>) was originally created by the College of American Pathologists by combining SNOMED RT and Clinical Terms Version 3.  SNOMED CT intellectual property rights were transferred to the SNOMED Standards Development Organisation (SDO) in the formal creation of the IHTSDO (International Health Terminology SDO).  
 </p>
 <p><b>Purpose</b><br/>
 SNOMED CT aims to improve patient care through the development of systems to record health care encounters accurately.
 </p>
 <p><b>Description</b><br/>
 SNOMED CT provides the core general terminology for the electronic health record (EHR).  The concepts have unique meanings and formal logic-based definitions organized into hierarchies.   Each International Release includes the core of the terminology (concepts, descriptions, and relationships), together with works to support the implementation and use of SNOMED CT, including subsets, cross maps to existing classifications and coding schemes, and an extensive set of guidelines.
