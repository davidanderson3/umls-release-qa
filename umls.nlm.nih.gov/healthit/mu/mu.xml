					<description>Proposed 2014 EHR certification criteria designate RxNorm as the vocabulary for medications. RxNorm, a standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs and drug delivery devices,
						is produced by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). RxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, Gold Standard, and Multum.
						By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.
