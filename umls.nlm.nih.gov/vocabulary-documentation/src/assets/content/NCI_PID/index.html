<p><strong>Authority</strong><br/> 
The Nature Pathway Interaction Database is produced and maintained by the Nature Publishing Group (NPG) and the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI).
</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br/>
The Nature Pathway Interaction Database serves as a reference source of biomolecular interactions and for use to run computational analyses.
</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br/>
The database is an NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) property that consists of identification codes for  pathways; links to information about known biomolecular interactions and key cellular processes assembled into signaling pathways. It can be used by the NCIt Browser to link a pathway concept to the source pathway information.
</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong><br/> 
The Nature Pathway Interaction Database  is employed by the cancer research community and others interested in cellular pathways, such as neuroscientists, developmental biologists, and immunologists.
</p>
<p><strong>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</strong><br/>
The Nature Pathway Interaction Database is updated annually as part of the <a href="../NCI/index.html">NCI Thesaurus</a> in the Metathesaurus.
