  NIC interventions are grouped hierarchically into 30 classes within seven domains. The seven domains are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Behavioral</li>

    <li>Community</li>

    <li>Health System</li>

    <li>Physiological: Basic</li>

    <li>Physiological: Complex</li>

    <li>Safety</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Domains, classes, and interventions include definitions. Interventions also include sets of activities to carry out the interventions and references for background reading.</p>
