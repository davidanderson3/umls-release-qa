<h3>Summary of Changes:</h3>
<p>There were no changes to the original file format or to Metathesaurus source processing.  Beginning with MDR27_1 in the 2025AA release, we will no longer create "Americanized" versions of strings.  We will continue to create expansions of strings with abbreviations.</p>

<h3>Source Provided Files:</h3>
The UMLS uses MedDRA files distributed in the MedAscii directory:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>hlgt.asc </li>
  <li>hlgt_hlt.asc</li>
  <li>hlt.asc</li>
  <li>hlt_pt.asc</li>
  <li>intl_ord.asc</li>
  <li>llt.asc</li>
  <li>mdhier.asc</li>
  <li>pt.asc</li>
  <li>smq_content.asc</li>

<h3>Identifiers:</h3>
<p>Overview: Lower Level Terms ("LLT"s) in MedDRA have any of the
following relationships to their "PT":</p>
<ul>
  <li>Synonyms: Different terms for the same concept inherent in the
"PT"
(e.g., "PT" Arthritis and its subordinate "LLT" Joint inflammation)</li>
  <li>Lexical variants: Different word forms for the same expression.
These include full names vs. abbreviations and direct vs. inverted word
order (e.g., "PT" Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and its
subordinate
"LLT" AIDS or "PT" Biopsy tongue and its subordinate "LLT" Tongue biopsy).</li>
  <li>Quasi-synonyms: Quasi-synonyms are terms that are not precisely
the same meaning as another term, but are treated as synonymous in a
given terminology. These include site and laterality descriptions
(e.g., "PT" Otitis externa and its subordinate "LLT" Bilateral otitis
externa).</li>
  <li>Sub-element: Sub-elements (of the parent "PT") are represented by
"LLT"s with more detailed information such as anatomic specificity
(e.g.,
"PT"Contusion with "LLT" Bruising of face or "LLT" Bruising of leg).</li>
  <li>Identical "LLT": One "LLT" is identical to its "PT" for data entry
purposes (e.g., "PT" Dementia Alzheimer&#8217;s type and its subordinate "LLT"
Dementia Alzheimer&#8217;s type). In this instance, the "LLT" and parent "PT"
have
the same MedDRA code but appear at both levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since MedDRA does not indicate which "LLT"s share the same meaning
with
their "PT", all "LLT"s are assigned the same the same Source-asserted
Descriptor Identifer (SDUI).&nbsp; A descriptor is a collection of
concepts (or atoms if there is no concept level organization) that are
considered to be closely related (but not necessarily synonymous).</p>
<p>Identifiers are assigned as follows:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CODE: Populated by the "code" fields in original data files, e.g.
the code for an "LLT" or "OL" atom comes from the llt_code field in
llt.asc</li>
  <li>SAUI: Not Applicable</li>
  <li>SCUI: Not Applicable</li>
  <li>SDUI: Populated by the "code" fields in original data files,
except for TTY = "LLT" and TTY = "OL", where the pt_code field from
llt.asc
is used.
This is because every "PT" has one identical "LLT" for data entry
purposes.
In addition, LLTs may be synonyms, lexical variants, quasi-synonyms, or
sub-elements of their "PT".
Therefore, the pt_code is represented in MRCONSO as a Source-asserted
Descriptor Identifier (SDUI), indicating that the "LLT" and "PT" are
closely
related but not necessarily synonymous.
