<p><strong>Authority</strong><br/> 
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Children's Study (NCS), and the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) produce the NICHD Terminology.
</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br/>
The NICHD Terminology provides standardized terminology for coding pediatric clinical trials and other research activities.
</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br/>
The terminology is a core library of harmonized pediatric terms, beginning with a focus on neonatal and infant examination concepts as part of a broader terminology framework. Each term is represented as a separate concept, and assigned a unique code, term definition, and synonym/abbreviation, where required. Each newborn examination concept has an association relationship, Concept in Subset: Newborn Screening, for easy retrieval of the terminology.
</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong><br/> 
The terminology is employed by the pediatric and neonatal research community.
</p>
<p><strong>Update Frequency</strong><br/>
The NICHD Terminology  is updated monthly.
</p>
<p><strong>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</strong><br/>
The NICHD Terminology  is updated annually as part of the <a href="../NCI/index.html">NCI Thesaurus</a> in the Metathesaurus.
