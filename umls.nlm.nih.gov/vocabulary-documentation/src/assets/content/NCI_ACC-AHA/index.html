<p><strong>Description</strong><br/> 
  NCI_ACC-AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Clinical Data Terminology) is a set of terms intended to represent key data elements and definitions for electronic health records (EHRs) created for patients with cardiovascular disorders. The goals of developing these clinical data standards include: to establish a consistent, interoperable, and universal clinical vocabulary as a foundation for both clinical care and clinical research, including clinical trials; to promote the ubiquitous use of EHRs and facilitate the exchange of data across systems through harmonized, standardized definitions of key data elements; to facilitate the further development of clinical registries, quality and performance improvement programs, outcomes evaluations, and clinical research, including the comparison of results within and across these initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</strong><br/>
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Clinical Data Terminology is updated annually as part of the <a href="../NCI/index.html">NCI Thesaurus</a> in the Metathesaurus.</p>
