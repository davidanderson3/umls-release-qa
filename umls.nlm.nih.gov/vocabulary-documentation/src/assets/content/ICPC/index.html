  <p><b>Authority</b><br>
  The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) is produced by the World Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associates of General Practitioners/Family Physicians (WONCA) now known as the World Organization of Family Doctors (Wonca). ICPC is maintained and updated by the International Classification Committee of Wonca (WICC).</p>

  <p><b>Purpose</b><br>
  ICPC is an epidemiological tool used to classify data about three elements of the health care encounter: reasons for encounter (RFE), diagnosis or problem, and process of care.</p>

  <p><b>Description</b><br>
  ICPC is based on a biaxial structure with 17 chapters on an axis and seven components on the other. The 17 chapters are based on the systems of the human body with two additional chapters, one for psychological problems and one for social problems. The seven components are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>symptoms, complaints</li>

    <li>diagnostic screening, prevention</li>

    <li>treatment, procedures, medication</li>

    <li>test results</li>

    <li>administrative</li>

    <li>other</li>

    <li>diagnoses, diseases</li>
  </ol>
