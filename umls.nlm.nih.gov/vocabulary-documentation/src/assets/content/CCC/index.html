  <p><b>Authority</b><br />
    Dr. Virginia Saba and colleagues at the Georgetown University School of Nursing developed the Home Health Care Classification (HHCC) System, now known as the Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System, version 2.5. The CCC is hosted by HCA Healthcare.</p>

  <p><b>Purpose</b><br />
    CCC provides a standardized framework and a unique coding
    structure for assessing, documenting, and classifying patient
    care by nurses and other clinical practitioners.</p>

  <p><b>Description</b><br />
    CCC is composed of two sets of interrelated terminologies Nursing Diagnoses and Nursing Interventions. These terminologies are classified using a coded framework consisting of 21 Care Components, which are modeled around the six steps of the Nursing Process Standards of Care. The six steps are Diagnosis, Outcome Identification, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation, and Assessment.</p>

  <p><b>Audience</b><br />
    Nurses, nurse practitioners, administrators,
    educators, and researchers use CCC.</p>

  <!--<p><b>Update Frequency</b><br />
 Now known as CCC, the classification is updated irregularly;
 it was last updated in 2004.</p> -->

  <p><b>Metathesaurus Update Frequency</b><br />
    CCC is updated in the Metathesaurus as resources permit.</p>
