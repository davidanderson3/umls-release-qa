<p><strong>Authority</strong><br/> Orphanet was created by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in 1997 and its efforts are co-funded by the European Union. The Orphanet Nomenclature is developed by Orphanet, INSERM Unit US14.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>
<br >Orphanet is a source of rare disease and orphan drug content. It is developed based on peer-reviewed journal articles and internationally recognized experts. This addition to the UMLS is based in part on work done by SNOMED International and INSERM to produce a <a href="https://www.snomed.org/news-and-events/articles/INSERM-SNOMED-Intl-SCT-Orphanet-Map">mapping</a> between SNOMED CT and Orphanet.<br>

<br>The three goals of Orphanet are:
<ol>
<li>Improve the visibility of rare diseases in the fields of healthcare and research by maintaining the Orphanet rare disease nomenclature (ORPHAcode): providing a common language to understand each other across the rare disease field.</li>
<li>Provide high-quality information on rare diseases and expertise, ensuring equal access to knowledge for all stakeholders: orientating users and actors in the field in the mass of information online.</li>
<li>Contribute to generating knowledge on rare diseases: piecing together the parts of the puzzle to better understand rare diseases.</li>
</ol>
