            <strong>
                Problem:
            </strong>
            The 2021AB version of the UMLS Metathesaurus includes version 2.71 of LNC-DE-DE (LOINC Linguistic Variant -
            German, Germany). LOINC found issues with this version and reverted to version 2.70. For the most current
            versions of LOINC Linguistic Variants, see:

            <strong>
                Problem:
            </strong>
            22 rows in MRREL have the wrong relation label (RELA). The issue affects SAB=SCTSPA rows where
            RELA=has_count_of_active_ingredient and RELA=count_of_active_ingredient_of. For SAB=SCTSPA, these relation
            labels should be swapped. Rows with RELA=has_count_of_active_ingredient should have
            RELA=count_of_active_ingredient_of, and rows with RELA=count_of_active_ingredient_of should have
            RELA=has_count_of_active_ingredient.

            Edit the corresponding table creation script (e.g. oracle_tables.sql or mysql_tables.sql) and change the
            length of the TTYL field to 400 instead of 300. For Oracle users, also edit the MRSAB.ctl file and set TTYL
            field to char(400) instead of char(300).

                Two HT terms were misspelled in the file received from the source. The terms GENITOURINIARY and NEPLASIA
                were placed under the RHT, adding two false axes to the hierarchy. Both of these terms are also present
                in their correctly spelled forms, GENITOURINARY and NEOPLASIA.

            This bug affects the following Metathesaurus files: MRCONSO.RRF, MRSAT.RRF, MRMAP.RRF, MRRANK.RRF
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Problem:
            </strong>
            MRCONSO.RRF contains Mapset metadata CUIs that describe mappings in the UMLS. These CUIs are all assigned
            the term type (TTY) 'XM'. The CUI 'C1704201' contains the term 'LNC215 to CPT2005 Mappings' which is the
            only term in this CUI. In 2009AA, this term was erroneously assigned an NLM 'MTHU' code that was shared by
            an term with a higher ranking term type (MRRANK.RRF). Due to the error, all of the rows in MRMAP.RRF that
            contain the data for the 'LNC215 to CPT2005 Mappings' are attached to the wrong CUI ('C2599619' rather than
            'C1704201'). All of the attributes associated with this map in MRSAT.RRF are also attached to AUI
            'A16416485', which belongs to CUI 'C2599619'

        <p>
            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            If you are a user who is interested in using the LNC215 to CPT2005 mapping from MRMAP.RRF, please use the
            2008AB release, because the actual content for the map does not change from release to release. NLM will
            correct the error for the 2009AB UMLS release.

            \342, \200 and \223.

            perl -ne '{s/\342\200\223/-/g;print}' MRCONSO.RRF

            perl -ne '{s/\342\200\223/-/g;print}' MRSAT.RRF

        <p>
            These errors will be corrected in the 2007AC release.

                <br />
            </strong>
            Oracle users receive errors when trying to load the file RXW_JPN.RRF.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            <br />
            The log file will report a series of errors like the one below:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Record 6171: Rejected - Error on table MRXW_JPN, column WD.
                <br />
                Field in data file exceeds maximum length
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The error occurs because Oracle interprets the length of the WD column of the MRXW_JPN table in terms of
            BYTE semantics, instead of CHAR semantics.&nbsp; To force SQL*Loader to handle this properly, the
            MRXW_JPN.ctl SQL*Loader control file can be edited to include this line:
        </p>
        <p>
            characterset UTF8 length semantics char
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the complete MRXW_JPN.ctl file would be as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                options (direct=true)

                <strong>
                    characterset UTF8 length semantics char
                </strong>
                <br />
                infile 'MRXW_JPN.RRF' "str X'7c0a'"
                <br />

                <br />
                fields terminated by '|'
                <br />
                trailing nullcols
                <br />
                (LAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char(3),

                WD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char(100),

                <br />
                )
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            With this change, the populate_oracle_db.csh script should run to completion without any errors.

        </p>
        <p>
            If you have already created a subset, edit the file "oracle_tables.sql" or "mysql_tables.sql" so that the
            TTYL field has a length of 200 (instead of 100) and the PAUI field has a VARCHAR (or in Oracle VARCHAR2)
            data type with length 9 (instead of CHAR(8)). If loading Oracle scripts, also edit the SQL*Loader control
            files "MRSAB.ctl" and "MRHIER.ctl" to accordingly set the lengths of the TTYL and PAUI fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to creating a subset:
        </p>
        <p>
            Edit the MMSYS/config/mrpluscolsfiles.dat file. Change the lines
        </p>
        <p>
            TTYL|MRCOLS|varchar(100)|Term type list for a source||||06-DEC-06|
            <br />
            PAUI|MRCOLS|char(8)|Unique identifier for parent atom||||06-DEC-06|
        </p>
        <p>
            To this:
        </p>
        <p>
            TTYL|MRCOLS|varchar(200)|Term type list for a source||||06-DEC-06|

            Users who create an ORF subset and select one or all of the following options: Remove Source Term Type
            Suppressible Data, Remove Editor Assigned Suppressible Data, or Remove Obsolete Data, will find the line
            "Suppressible terms were included in the subset." at the bottom of their MMSYS.log file.

        <p>
            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            The error exists in the production of the log file, not in the data files. Examination of the data files
            will show that suppressible terms were not included in the subset, in relation to the options the user
            checked. (For example, if Remove Obsolete Data was checked only obsolete terms will be removed.) The error
            in the log file will be corrected for the 2006AD release.

            The software update for Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0 Release 4 for Mac OS X v10.4.5 will
            change the default version of Java virtual machine from Java 1.4.2 to Java 5.0. This may cause problems with
            MetamorphoSys.

                Solution:

            Reset the default Java virtual machine. Instructions are available from Apple at
            http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303526. The 2006AC release of the UMLS will call the correct
            JRE, regardless of the default settings.

                Title: Problem with MRHIER.RRF References
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Problem:
            </strong>
            The removal of MRCXT.RRF from the default data set for 2006AA had the unintended consequence of affecting
            hierarchy information in MRHIER.RRF, such that the information cannot be properly resolved by MetamorphoSys
            in all cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, in cases where a source with hierarchies is selectively subsetted, a situation may result
            where the PTR field of MRHIER.RRF contains references to AUI values that do not exist in MRCONSO.RRF.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Scope:
            </strong>
            This will likely not be an issue for the majority of users. In the event that a user's configuration causes
            MetamorphoSys to either keep or remove sources in their entirety, this problematic data condition does not
            arise.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are four known ways in which this condition might occur. Each involves removing parts of sources that
            contain hierarchies without removing the entire source and operating with an input set that does not contain
            MRCXT data:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using the "remove UTF8" option in the output handler configuration panel in conjunction with a source
                list that included sources with UTF-8 characters and a hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>
                Selecting "remove suppressible data" from the suppressible termgroups advanced options and choosing
                suppressible termgroups from among the atoms of a source that contains hierarchies
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the SampleMetaFilter (very rare)
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a user-created filter that selectively removes atoms from sources with hierarchies (very rare)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The first two situations will by far be the most common.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using the "remove UTF8" condition in conjunction with a Source List configuration that includes sources
            with UTF-8 characters, the resulting MRHIER.RRF will contain this data condition. The set of sources
            containing UTF-8 characters (and contexts) includes:

            When selecting term types to be suppressible that participate in contexts and using the advanced options
            "remove suppressible data" option, the resulting MRHIER.RRF will contain this data condition.

            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            There is a work-around for this problem, albeit a time-consuming one. As indicated above, this problem
            results when the input set does not contain MRCXT.RRF data. The presence of MRCXT.RRF on the input side
            would guarantee output data free of this data condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user should take the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Generate an output set using the desired configuration, making sure not to select options matching any
                of the four conditions described above. The output subset should then contain all of the hierarchy data
                for the set of sources selected for inclusion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the MRCXT builder to create a MRCXT.RRF file matching the MRHIER.RRF file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the first output set (including MRCXT.RRF) as the input and create a second output, this time using
                the options that created the initial problem. This second output set should be what the user is looking
                for.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So, consider the case where the user wanted the "keep everything" subset with the "remove UTF-8" option
            selected. In order to achieve this via the work-around, the user could take the following actions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Configure the Source List to include all sources.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure that "remove UTF-8" was NOT checked in the output handler configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Generate the output set.
            </li>
            <li>
                Run the MRCXT Builder to generate a full MRCXT.RRF file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-configure MetamorphoSys to point to the set of data generated in #1-4. Again include all sources but
                this time make sure that "remove UTF-8" IS checked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Generate a second output set. This one will contain correctly resolved MRHIER.RRF data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the first set of output files (unless additional subsets are to be made from it).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            A more technically sophisticated user could also use a perl script like the one below to manually remove the
            unwanted MRHIER.RRF entries from their subset.
        </p>
        <pre>	 #!/usr/local/bin/perl

open (MRCONSO,"MRCONSO.RRF") || die "Could not open MRCONSO.RRF : $! $?\n"; while (&lsaquo;MRCONSO&rsaquo;) {
  chop;
  split /\|/;
  $auis{$_[7]} = 1;
}
close (MRCONSO);
open (MRHIER,"MRHIER.RRF") || die "Could not open MRHIER.RRF : $! $?\n"; while (&lsaquo;MRHIER&rsaquo;) {
  chop;
  split /\|/;
  $ptr = $_[6];
  @ptr_auis = split /./, $ptr;
  $missing = 0;
  foreach $aui (@ptr_auis) {
     unless ($auis{$aui}) {
       $missing = 1;
       last;
     }
  }
  print "$_\n" unless $missing;
}
close (MRHIER);
	 </pre>
        <p>
            The output of this script would be a corrected MRHIER.RRF file.

                Problem:
            </strong>
            When generating an ORF subset with the database load script option, the ATN field is set to 20 chars instead
            of 50.&nbsp; Any sources that have ATN values greater than 20 that are loaded into a database using one of
            our scripts produces an error (data is longer than the field length).

                Problem:
            </strong>
            We have found issues in the most recent Tiger update (10.4.2) that may cause new problems for users,
            including application crashes. We are investigating and expect Apple to remedy these issues. One specific
            problem: Mac OS Tiger users receive an error message stating "Resources temporarily unavailable" when
            running MetamorphoSys.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            This error has been corrected in the 2005AC release of the UMLS. If you must use an older version, close all
            unnecessary applications. Macintosh Tiger users (OS X 10.4) are reminded to quit all other applications
            (including dashboard widgets) to avoid the Mac "resource temporarily unavailable" error.

                Problem:
            </strong>
            In some circumstances disk full errors are not properly detected. MetamorphoSys may appear to complete
            correctly but files are corrupted. Files may include truncated lines or null characters inserted into the
            data.

            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            Users must be certain that they have adequate disk space before using MetamorphoSys.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Problem:
            </strong>
            There are serious errors in the NDDF update in 2005AA that affect not only NDDF in the Metathesaurus, but
            also RxNorm. Drug data that was added to the Metathesaurus from the November NDDF update are correct, but
            over 100,000 NDDF drug names already in the Metathesaurus were incorrectly marked as obsolete. NDDF data, as
            a separate source, and within the RxNorm subset, should not be used, or should be used with extreme caution.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            A new RxNorm Cumulative Release File, including corrected NDDF data, will be available in late February or
            early March.
            <br />
            NDDF will be corrected in the UMLS 2005AB release, scheduled to be available in April 2005.

        <p>
            <strong>
                Problem:
            </strong>
            The RxNorm Cumulative Update of 11/17/2004 contains non-matching codes for RxNorm atoms. This update is
            based on the 2004AC release of the UMLS, but contains all new codes for RxNorm atoms. These codes do not
            correspond to previously assigned codes and the update cannot be applied to existing RxNorm data.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Solution:
            </strong>
            RxNorm data will be resynchronized with the 2005AA release, updated with SNOMED CT drug data, and the full
            and corrected Cumulative RxNorm will be released in late February or early March.

                Condition:
            </strong>
            User selects RxNorm subset from the initial Default Subsets list, then disables the filter by unchecking the
            box on the RxNorm Output Options tab.

            <br />
            <strong>
                Bug:
            </strong>
            Unchecking the box does not disable the filter. The RxNorm filter is applied regardless of the state of the
            checkbox.

            Do not pick RxNorm filter on the Install menu and then attempt to deselect this option on the RxNorm Output
            Option tab.
