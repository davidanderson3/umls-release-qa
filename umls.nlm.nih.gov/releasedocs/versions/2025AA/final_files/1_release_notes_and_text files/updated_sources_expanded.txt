Discussion:
As of this release, the UMLS will no longer create atoms for the 
American spellings of MDR. MDR data includes British spellings with its 
American spelling counterpart included at the LLT level.  

The relationship attribute (RELA) "mth_british_form_of/mth_has_british_form" has been deprecated.

Expanded versions of strings with identified abbreviations will continue 
to be made.
