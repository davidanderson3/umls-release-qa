<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">UMLS Metathesaurus Precomputed Subsets</span><br /></strong></p>
In past years, we have required MetamorphoSys to install and customize the UMLS Metathesaurus. We are now providing ready-to-use precomputed subsets of the UMLS Metathesaurus that require no installation or customization. As of 2024AB, precomputed subsets include obsolete and suppressible content.
<ul>
<li><strong>UMLS Metathesaurus Full Subset</strong>: Complete Metathesaurus data.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UMLS Metathesaurus Level 0 Subset</strong>: Includes only level 0 source vocabularies. Level 0 vocabularies do not have any additional restrictions beyond the standard license terms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<strong style="font-size: 14pt;">UMLS Metathesaurus History Files</strong><br />
<p>The following files contain historical data from the UMLS Metathesaurus starting with the 2004AA release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concept History (MRCONSO_HISTORY.txt)&nbsp;</strong>- This file contains all atoms, concepts, and codes dropped from the UMLS Metathesaurus MRCONSO.RRF.</li>
<li><strong>Relation History (MRREL_HISTORY.txt)</strong>- This file contains all relations dropped from the UMLS Metathesaurus MRREL.RRF file.</li>

Send a request to the NLM Help Desk (https://support.nlm.nih.gov/support/create-case/) with the subject line: "UMLS Community". Be sure to include a link to your source code so that other UMLS users can adapt your tool. We are especially interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database load scripts&nbsp;</li>
<li>Transformation scripts that convert UMLS data into other formats (for example, RDF or JSON)</li>
<li>Scripts that automate any aspect of UMLS installation</li>
<li>Applications that leverage UMLS in text processing<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
