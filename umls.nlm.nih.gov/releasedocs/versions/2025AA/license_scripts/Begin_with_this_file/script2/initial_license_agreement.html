			License Agreement for Use of the UMLS&reg; Metathesaurus&reg;
		</h2>

		<div>
			<p>
				This Agreement is made by and between the National Library of
				Medicine, Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter
				referred to as &quot;NLM&quot;) and the LICENSEE.
			</p>

			<p>
				WHEREAS, the NLM was established by statute in order to assist the
				advancement of medical and related sciences, and to aid the
				dissemination and exchange of scientific and other information
				important to the progress of medicine and to the public health
				(section 465 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended (42 U.S.C.
				section 286)), and to carry out this purpose has been authorized to
				develop the Unified Medical Language System &reg; (UMLS) to facilitate
				the retrieval and integration of machine-readable biomedical
				information from disparate sources;
			</p>

			<p>
				WHEREAS, the NLM's UMLS project has produced the UMLS Metathesaurus, a
				machine-readable vocabulary knowledge source, that is useful in a
				variety of settings;
			</p>

			<p>
				WHEREAS, the LICENSEE is willing to use the UMLS Metathesaurus at its
				sole risk and at no expense to NLM, which will result in information
				useful to NLM, may provide immediate improvements in biomedical
				information transfer to segments of the biomedical community, and is
				consistent with NLM's statutory functions,
			</p>

			<p>NOW THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					The NLM hereby grants a nonexclusive, non-transferable right to
					LICENSEE to use the UMLS Metathesaurus and incorporate its content
					in any computer applications or systems designed to improve access
					to biomedical information of any type subject to the restrictions in
					other provisions of this Agreement. The names and addresses of
					licensees authorized to use the UMLS products are public
					information.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					No charges, usage fees, or royalties will be paid to NLM.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					LICENSEE is prohibited from distributing the UMLS Metathesaurus or
					subsets of it, including individual vocabulary sources within the
					Metathesaurus, except (a) as an integral part of computer
					applications developed by LICENSEE for a purpose other than
					redistribution of vocabulary sources contained in the UMLS
					Metathesaurus and (b) if permitted by paragraph 12 of this
					agreement.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					LICENSEE agrees to inform NLM prior to distributing any
					application(s) in which it is using the UMLS Metathesaurus and is
					encouraged to inform NLM of any difficulties encountered in using
					the UMLS Metathesaurus, and changes or enhancements to the UMLS
					Metathesaurus that would make it more useful to LICENSEE and its
					user groups.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					Within 30 days of the end of any calendar year in which LICENSEE
					makes use of the UMLS Metathesaurus, LICENSEE agrees to provide NLM
					with a brief report on the usefulness of the UMLS Metathesaurus in
					general and, if applicable, on the usefulness of CPT in the UMLS
					format in particular. LICENSEE is strongly encouraged to submit to
					NLM locally developed extensions to the UMLS Metathesaurus that are
					potentially useful to other UMLS users for consideration for
					potential inclusion in the UMLS Metathesaurus.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					NLM represents that the data provided under this Agreement were
					formatted with a reasonable standard of care, but makes no
					warranties express or implied, including no warranty of
					merchantability or fitness for particular purpose, regarding the
					accuracy or completeness of the data or that the machine-readable
					copy is error free. Therefore, LICENSEE agrees to hold NLM, the
					Government, and any organization contributing a vocabulary source to
					the UMLS Metathesaurus free from any liability resulting from errors
					in terminology or other data or on the machine-readable copy. NLM
					and such other organizations disclaim any liability for any
					consequences due to use, misuse, or interpretation of information
					contained or not contained in the UMLS Metathesaurus.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					NLM represents that its ability to continue to include certain
					vocabulary sources within the UMLS Metathesaurus is dependent on
					continuing contractual relations or agreements with the copyright
					holders for these vocabulary sources. Therefore, LICENSEE agrees to
					hold NLM and the individual copyright holder free from any liability
					resulting from the removal of any vocabulary source from future
					editions of the UMLS Metathesaurus.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					NLM reserves the right to change the type and format of its
					machine-readable data. NLM agrees to inform LICENSEE of any changes
					to the format of the UMLS Metathesaurus, EXCEPT the addition of
					entirely new data elements to the Metathesaurus, at least 90 days
					before the data are distributed.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					The presence in the UMLS Metathesaurus of vocabulary or data
					produced by organizations other than NLM does not imply any
					endorsement of the UMLS Metathesaurus by these organizations.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					LICENSEE shall acknowledge NLM as its source of the UMLS
					Metathesaurus, citing the year and version number, in a suitable and
					customary manner but may not in any way indicate or imply that NLM
					or any of the organizations whose vocabulary sources are included in
					the UMLS has endorsed LICENSEE or its products.<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>
					Some of the Material in the UMLS Metathesaurus is from copyrighted
					sources. If LICENSEE uses any material from copyrighted sources from
					the UMLS Metathesaurus:<br />
					<br />
					a) the LICENSEE is required to display in full, prior to providing
					user access to the Metathesaurus or any of the vocabulary sources
					within the UMLS, the following wording in order that its users be
					made aware of these copyright constraints:<br /><br />
					&quot;Some material in the UMLS Metathesaurus is from copyrighted
					sources of the respective copyright holders. Users of the UMLS
					Metathesaurus are solely responsible for compliance with any
					copyright, patent or trademark restrictions and are referred to the
					copyright, patent or trademark notices appearing in the original
					sources, all of which are hereby incorporated by
					reference.&quot;;<br />

					<br />
					to display a list of all of the vocabularies contained within the
					UMLS Metathesaurus that are used in the LICENSEE's application; and
					to indicate for each vocabulary any appropriate copyright notice and
					whether the entire contents are present or only a portion of it.<br />
					<br />
					b) the LICENSEE is prohibited from altering UMLS and other
					vocabulary source content contained within the UMLS Metathesaurus,
					but may include content from other sources in applications that also
					contain content from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The LICENSEE may not
					imply in any way that data from other sources is part of the UMLS
					Metathesaurus or of any of its vocabulary sources.<br />
					<br />
					c) the LICENSEE is required to include in its applications
					identifiers from the UMLS Metathesaurus such that the original
					source vocabularies for any data obtained from the UMLS
					Metathesaurus can be determined by reference to a complete version
					of the UMLS Metathesaurus.<br />
