 </h2>
 <div>
  <p>
   This Agreement is made by and between the National Library of
					Medicine, Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter
					referred to as "NLM") and the LICENSEE.
  </p>
  <p>
   WHEREAS, the NLM was established by statute in order to assist the
					advancement of medical and related sciences, and to aid the
					dissemination and exchange of scientific and other information
					important to the progress of medicine and to the public health
					(section 465 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended (42 U.S.C.
					section 286)), and to carry out this purpose has been authorized to
					develop the Unified Medical Language System ® (UMLS) to facilitate
					the retrieval and integration of machine-readable biomedical
					information from disparate sources;
  </p>
  <p>
   WHEREAS, the NLM's UMLS project has produced the UMLS Metathesaurus, a
					machine-readable vocabulary knowledge source, that is useful in a
					variety of settings;
  </p>
  <p>
   WHEREAS, the LICENSEE is willing to use the UMLS Metathesaurus at its
					sole risk and at no expense to NLM, which will result in information
					useful to NLM, may provide immediate improvements in biomedical
					information transfer to segments of the biomedical community, and is
					consistent with NLM's statutory functions,
  </p>
  <p>
   NOW THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    The NLM hereby grants a nonexclusive, non-transferable right to
						LICENSEE to use the UMLS Metathesaurus and incorporate its content
						in any computer applications or systems designed to improve access
						to biomedical information of any type subject to the restrictions in
						other provisions of this Agreement. The names and addresses of
						licensees authorized to use the UMLS products are public
						information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    No charges, usage fees, or royalties will be paid to NLM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    LICENSEE is prohibited from distributing the UMLS Metathesaurus or
						subsets of it, including individual vocabulary sources within the
						Metathesaurus, except (a) as an integral part of computer
						applications developed by LICENSEE for a purpose other than
						redistribution of vocabulary sources contained in the UMLS
						Metathesaurus and (b) if permitted by paragraph 12 of this
						agreement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    LICENSEE agrees to inform NLM prior to distributing any
						application(s) in which it is using the UMLS Metathesaurus and is
						encouraged to inform NLM of any difficulties encountered in using
						the UMLS Metathesaurus, and changes or enhancements to the UMLS
						Metathesaurus that would make it more useful to LICENSEE and its
						user groups.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Within 30 days of the end of any calendar year in which LICENSEE
						makes use of the UMLS Metathesaurus, LICENSEE agrees to provide NLM
						with a brief report on the usefulness of the UMLS Metathesaurus in
						general and, if applicable, on the usefulness of CPT in the UMLS
						format in particular. LICENSEE is strongly encouraged to submit to
						NLM locally developed extensions to the UMLS Metathesaurus that are
						potentially useful to other UMLS users for consideration for
						potential inclusion in the UMLS Metathesaurus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    NLM represents that the data provided under this Agreement were
						formatted with a reasonable standard of care, but makes no
						warranties express or implied, including no warranty of
						merchantability or fitness for particular purpose, regarding the
						accuracy or completeness of the data or that the machine-readable
						copy is error free. Therefore, LICENSEE agrees to hold NLM, the
						Government, and any organization contributing a vocabulary source to
						the UMLS Metathesaurus free from any liability resulting from errors
						in terminology or other data or on the machine-readable copy. NLM
						and such other organizations disclaim any liability for any
						consequences due to use, misuse, or interpretation of information
						contained or not contained in the UMLS Metathesaurus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    NLM represents that its ability to continue to include certain
						vocabulary sources within the UMLS Metathesaurus is dependent on
						continuing contractual relations or agreements with the copyright
						holders for these vocabulary sources. Therefore, LICENSEE agrees to
						hold NLM and the individual copyright holder free from any liability
						resulting from the removal of any vocabulary source from future
						editions of the UMLS Metathesaurus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    NLM reserves the right to change the type and format of its
						machine-readable data. NLM agrees to inform LICENSEE of any changes
						to the format of the UMLS Metathesaurus, EXCEPT the addition of
						entirely new data elements to the Metathesaurus, at least 90 days
						before the data are distributed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    The presence in the UMLS Metathesaurus of vocabulary or data
						produced by organizations other than NLM does not imply any
						endorsement of the UMLS Metathesaurus by these organizations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    LICENSEE shall acknowledge NLM as its source of the UMLS
						Metathesaurus, citing the year and version number, in a suitable and
						customary manner but may not in any way indicate or imply that NLM
						or any of the organizations whose vocabulary sources are included in
						the UMLS has endorsed LICENSEE or its products.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Some of the Material in the UMLS Metathesaurus is from copyrighted
						sources. If LICENSEE uses any material from copyrighted sources from
						the UMLS Metathesaurus:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    a) the LICENSEE is required to display in full, prior to providing
						user access to the Metathesaurus or any of the vocabulary sources
						within the UMLS, the following wording in order that its users be
						made aware of these copyright constraints:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Some material in the UMLS Metathesaurus is from copyrighted
						sources of the respective copyright holders. Users of the UMLS
						Metathesaurus are solely responsible for compliance with any
						copyright, patent or trademark restrictions and are referred to the
						copyright, patent or trademark notices appearing in the original
						sources, all of which are hereby incorporated by
						reference.";
    <br/>
    <br/>
    to display a list of all of the vocabularies contained within the
						UMLS Metathesaurus that are used in the LICENSEE's application; and
						to indicate for each vocabulary any appropriate copyright notice and
						whether the entire contents are present or only a portion of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    b) the LICENSEE is prohibited from altering UMLS and other
						vocabulary source content contained within the UMLS Metathesaurus,
						but may include content from other sources in applications that also
						contain content from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The LICENSEE may not
						imply in any way that data from other sources is part of the UMLS
						Metathesaurus or of any of its vocabulary sources.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    c) the LICENSEE is required to include in its applications
						identifiers from the UMLS Metathesaurus such that the original
						source vocabularies for any data obtained from the UMLS
						Metathesaurus can be determined by reference to a complete version
						of the UMLS Metathesaurus.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    For material in the UMLS Metathesaurus obtained from some sources
						additional restrictions on LICENSEE's use may apply. The categories
						of additional restrictions are described below. The list of UMLS
						Metathesaurus Vocabulary Sources, which is part of this Agreement
						and is updated when each version of the Metathesaurus is released,
						indicates the category of additional restrictions, if any, that
						apply to each vocabulary source.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    LICENSEE should contact the copyright holder directly to discuss
						uses of a source vocabulary beyond those allowed under this license
						agreement. If LICENSEE or LICENSEE's end user has a separate
						agreement with the copyright holder for use of a UMLS Metathesaurus
						source vocabulary, LICENSEE or LICENSEE's end user may use
						vocabulary source content obtained from the UMLS Metathesaurus in

				content meets the Licensor's quality assurance, other governance
				processes, Standards and Regulations then the Licensor shall incorporate
				the modification into the SNOMED CT Core according to its schedule which
				will give due consideration as to when the proposed modification shall

  <strong>
   License Fees in Non-Member Territories
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  1.
  <strong>
   Introduction
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  1.1 This Appendix B sets out the license fees payable by the Licensee in
				respect of its activities in Non-Member Territories.
 </p>
 <p>
  1.2 The license fees set out in this Appendix B do not apply in respect
				of the Licensee's activities in any Non-Member Territory if that
				Non-Member Territory is a Sponsored Territory or was a Sponsored
				Territory at the time when the Licensee's activities in that Non-Member
				Territory were carried out.
 </p>
 <p>
  1.3 The Licensor may, in its sole discretion, waive the Licensee's
				obligation to pay any or all of the license fees set out in this
				Appendix B if the Licensor considers that the Licensee's activities in
				any Non-Member Territory are in support of charitable or humanitarian
				causes in that Non-Member Territory. Any waiver by the Licensor under
				this paragraph 1.3 may be revoked by the Licensor at any time, shall be
				without prejudice to any of the Licensor's other rights and remedies
				under this License Agreement and shall not relieve the Licensee of any
				of its other obligations under this License Agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  1.4 Beginning in 2015, license fees payable by the Licensee in respect
				of its activities in Non-Member Territories for each financial year
				shall be adjusted by the same percentage as the General Assembly of the
				Licensor agrees to adjust the Aggregate Annual Fee (as defined in the
				Licensor's Articles of Association) relative to the Aggregate Annual Fee
				in the previous year.
 </p>
 <p>
  1.5 For purposes of this Appendix B, but subject to paragraph 1.6, if a
				Hospital or a Practice is located on multiple physical sites, each such
				site shall be treated as a separate Hospital or Practice (as the case
				may be), and license fees shall be payable in respect of each such
				separate Hospital or Practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  1.6 The Licensor may, in its sole discretion, agree to treat multiple
				sites on which a Hospital or a Practice is located as a single site for
				purposes of this Appendix B.
 </p>
 <p>
  1.7 Notwithstanding anything else in this Appendix B, the deployment,
				distribution or licensing of any software that operates on a mobile
				device of any kind (including without limitation a mobile phone or
				tablet device), or any software or service that is accessed via the
				internet and enables users to extract or download any substantial
				portion of SNOMED CT, shall be treated as falling within paragraph 4 of
				this Appendix B (and not within paragraph 2).
 </p>
 <p>
  1.8 The Licensee's obligation to pay license fees in respect of any
				deployment of the International Release or any Licensee Product is not
				dependent on that deployment of the International Release or Licensee
				Product being used in a live or production environment.The Licensor may,
				in its sole discretion, waive the Licensee’s obligation to pay any or
				all of the license fees set out in this Appendix B in respect of any
				deployment of the International Release or Licensee Product in a
				non-production environment (such as a development or test environment).
 </p>
 <p>
  1.9 In any case where the Licensee is exempt from the requirement to pay
				license fees by reason of a Licensee Product or a Data Processing System
				being used exclusively in connection with a Qualifying Research Project,
				the Licensee shall report to the Licensor on the progress of that
				Qualifying Research Project in such manner as the Licensor may
				reasonably require. The Licensor may revoke the Licensee's exemption for
				Qualifying Research Projects provided in this Appendix B if the Licensee
				fails to comply with this paragraph 1.9.
 </p>
 <p>

  <strong>
   Data Processing Systems
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  2.1 The Licensee shall pay the following fees in respect of each
				Hospital or Practice in a Non-Member Territory in or to which the
				Licensee:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   (a) deploys the International Release (or any part of it) or any
					Licensee Product that contains the International Release (or any part
					of it) in a Data Processing System, unless that Data Processing System
					is used exclusively in connection with a Qualifying Research Project;
					or
  </p>
  <p>
   (b) deploys, distributes or licenses a Licensee Product that is or
					includes a Data Processing System, unless that Licensee Product is
					used exclusively in connection with a Qualifying Research Project.

 <p>
  2.2 The total fees payable by the Licensee in respect of a number of
				Practices that are departments of a single Hospital shall not exceed the
				fee applicable to the Hospital itself. For purposes of this Appendix B,
				a Practice is treated as a department of a Hospital only if: (a) it is
				located on the premises of that Hospital; and (b) it is funded solely by
				that Hospital. In any case where either or both of the conditions in the
				preceding sentence are not met in respect of any Practice, fees shall be
				payable in respect of that Practice in addition to any fees that are
				payable in respect of any Hospital.

				any person situated in, any Non-Member Territory in a manner that does
				not fall within paragraph 2 of this Appendix B, explaining the
