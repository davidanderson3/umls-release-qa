                        This content view contains the subset of SNOMED CT concepts that are most frequently used in
                        problem lists. The subset is derived from datasets from large health care institutions. The most
                        commonly used problem list terms are mapped to SNOMED CT and other UMLS sources. The use of
                        SNOMED CT contents in this subset is subject to the SNOMED CT license requirements. The use of
                        SNOMED CT is free in IHTSDO member countries (including the U.S.) and low income countries.

                        The creation of this content view is based on the list of SNOMED CT concept IDs in the latest
                        release of the CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT, excluding those that are retired from the
                        Subset. It contains all atoms linked to that SNOMED CT concept with LAT=ENG and SUPPRESS=N.
