<h1>The NLM Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)</h1>
<p>The Value Set Authority Center (VSAC) is provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. The VSAC provides downloadable access to all official versions of vocabulary Value Sets contained in the Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs)  that support Meaningful Use Stage 2.<br/>
The Value Sets in the VSAC describe the specific populations included and excluded in order to properly calculate each CQM.  Each Value Set consists of the numerical values and human-readable names, drawn from standard vocabularies such as SNOMED CT&reg; and ICD-10-CM, that are used to define one of the clinical concepts used in a quality measure (e.g.,  patients with diabetes, clinical visit). The content of the VSAC will gradually expand to incorporate Value Sets for other use cases, as well as for new measures and updates to existing measures.<br/>
Access to the Value Set Authority Center for viewing and/or downloading MU proprietary value sets, such as those including CPT&reg; or SNOMED CT&reg; codes, requires a free Unified Medical Language System&reg; Metathesaurus License. Please note it may take 1-5 business days to obtain a license.<br/>

<h3><a href="#">What services does the Value Set Authority Center offer?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>The Value Set Authority Center (VSAC) currently serves as the authority and central repository for the official versions of Value Sets that support Meaningful Use Stage 2 clinical quality measures. The VSAC provides search, retrieval and download capabilities through a Web interface and APIs. <br/>
	The VSAC will maintain and update the Value Sets consistent with the overall process for maintaining and updating the CQMs themselves.  Through the VSAC,  NLM draws upon the UMLS Metathesaurus and its responsibility as the central coordinating body for clinical terminology standards within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  to assure the on-going validity and accuracy of the Value Sets.<br/>
	In the future, the VSAC will provide authoring tools for users to create Value Sets.<br/>
	</p>    
</div>
<h3><a href="#">What are Value Sets?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>
	Value Sets are lists of specific values (terms and their codes) derived from single or multiple standard vocabularies used to define clinical concepts (e.g. patients with diabetes, clinical visit, reportable diseases) used  in quality measures and to support effective health information exchange. Although there are many uses for Value Sets, a primary purpose of the value sets currently represented in the NLM VSAC is to support Clinical Quality Measures prescribed for Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records.  Most of the value sets are therefore used to define the patient populations that should be included in the denominators and in the numerators when computing a clinical quality measure.<br/>
	</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#">How do I download Value Set data from the VSAC?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>
	Once you have a UMLS License, you may log into the Value Set Authority Center (VSAC). Using the filters within the VSAC Web application, you can currently search for specific Value Sets, to view or to download. You can search by text words, or you can limit your search to specific Clinical Quality Measures and unique identifiers. At the present time, users interested in identifying at one time all of the Value Sets associated with subsets of the MU Quality measures, such as All EP or All EH measures
	are advised to access the VSAC resources though USHIK (see below), which for this purpose is the authoritative source for the electronic versions of the MU quality measure specifications.<br/>	
	</p>	
</div>
<h3><a href="#">What is the model used for distributing Value Set data from the VSAC?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>
	NLM has implemented the <a href = "http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_Suppl_SVS_Rev2-1_TI_2010-08-10.pdf" target = "_blank"> Sharing Value Sets (SVS) technical framework (pdf).</a>  Alternatively, users may wish to access the Value Set data via the technical framework provided by  CTS-2 , developed and maintained by the  <a href = "http://informatics.mayo.edu/cts2/index.php/About" target = "_blank">Mayo Clinic</a>.
	</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#">What are Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs)?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>
	According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, &quot;Clinical quality measures, or CQMs, are tools that help us measure and track the quality of healthcare services provided by physicians, nurses, hospitals and others in our health care system.  These measures use a wide variety of data that are associated with a provider's ability to deliver high-quality care or relate to long term goals for health care quality.  Many factors are included in CQMs such as health outcomes, processes and systems in place at a facility, patient perceptions, and treatments provided.&quot;	
	</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#">How can I access official versions of the Stage 2 Meaningful Use CQMs?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>
	The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides the official source for clinical quality measures for Eligible Providers and Eligible Hospitals required to meet Meaningful Use (MU).<br/>
	Additionally, the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research offers the United States Health Information Knowledgebase (USHIK) as an authoritative one-stop shop for public access to Meaningful Use quality measure components. The USHIK provides technical specifications for the MU clinical quality measures including their descriptions, computation logic, data elements, context, version comparisons, and value (code) sets.  Measures and value sets are available in Excel, PDF and XML.<br/>
	Please note that to use USHIK to access VSAC resources  or to view and/or download MU proprietary Value Sets , such as those including CPT&reg; codes or SNOMED CT&reg; codes,  will require a free Unified Medical Language System&reg; Metathesaurus License, available from NLM.
