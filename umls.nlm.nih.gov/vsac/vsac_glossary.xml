                A set of concept representations that were in effect at a specific time for a particular version of a Value Set. 
                See Value Set. The Value Set and the Expanded Value Set concepts are similar to the programming concepts of 
                Class and Instance of Class. This may also be called a value set resolution or resolved value set.

            <definition>
                A set of concepts that is specified in terms of a list of concepts. 
                Extension is a semantics term defined as any set of objects that can be connoted by a word, 
                phrase, or a symbol. For example, “cancer” can be defined as “disease”, so is “tuberculosis”, 
                “depression”, “alcoholism”, etc.

                A set of concepts that is specified in terms of the ―intension of use, for example 
                all concepts that are children of this node in a tree of concepts. Intensional value sets often have some 
                kind of algorithmic basis for selection of concepts.

                A uniquely identifiable set of valid concept representations where any concept representation can be tested to 
                determine whether or not it is a member of the 190 value set. A value set may be a simple flat list of concept 
                codes drawn from a single code system, or it might be an unbounded hierarchical set of possibly post-coordinated 
                expressions drawn from multiple code systems. Also known as a list of valid concept codes.
                A valid concept is a concept that would be logically representative of the Value Set that it belongs to, 
                for example for the Value Set ―Colours of the rainbow, ―yellow would be a valid concept.
